      <h1>Introduction</h1> <br><br>

      The app "FSYourTime" is designed for students of Frankfurt School of Finance & Management and aims to support the manual time tracking of students’ individual workload. Every module with 6 ECTS points is calculated to have a workload of 150 hours in summary. These 150 hours of workload are composed of three different effort categories: attendance in lectures, self-learning time and exam preparation. The two latter categories are further divided into subcategories which will be described later on.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, the tracked workload should only include the time a student needs to prepare and follow up a certain module. This results in an overview of students’ actual workload for each module and can give Frankfurt School of Finance & Management a guideline for future module conception.<br>
